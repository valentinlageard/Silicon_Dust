<p>To run the sessions, the MC has tools at his disposal :
- <strong>Threats clocks and moves</strong> to manage looming and progressively developing threats.
- <strong>Area networks</strong> and <strong>alarm clocks</strong> to manage infiltration and exfiltration of secure locations.
- <strong>Clue pointers</strong> to manage investigations and the progressive revelation of hidden truths.
- <strong>Heat clocks</strong> to manage how much the players are about to get caught by local authorities.
- <strong>Trauma moves</strong> to manage how the player's trauma impact their life.
- <strong>Habitat toolsets</strong> to create and manage habitats.
- <strong>World map</strong> to keep track of the places established during play.</p>
<h2 id="threats">Threats</h2>
<p>Threats are developping problems that manifest in an ever growing manner to reach the point of no-return where the threat fully manifest. Threats can be an organization plotting in the shadows, an individual pursueing its own mission, societal unrest turned rebellion, ...</p>
<p>Threats have <strong>Threat Moves</strong> which are fictional effects triggered whenever the fiction demands it or as a result of a Partial or Miss.
Threats may have associated <strong>Threat Clocks</strong> if the threat is progressive. A threat clock has 6 unfilled tracks at the beginning. These tracks are filled along the threat's development whenever the fiction demands it or as a result of a Partial or a Miss. Threat clocks may be stopped or reset and the threat may even be removed or changed if the fiction implies it. If the local yakuza's oyabun is killed, the yakuza threat may be reset, removed or changed.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="area-networks-and-alarm-clock">Area networks and alarm clock</h2>
<p>Whenever players want to introduce, pass through or escape a secured area, make a quick map of the zones, their features and their interconnections.</p>
<p>Example :</p>
<p><strong>Psytech's secret laboratory :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Exterior : extreme temperature and pressure, egocasting antenna. Connections : Entrance.</li>
<li>Entrance : pressurized sas and automatic turrets. Connections : Exterior, Crew facility, Egocasting facility.</li>
<li>Egocasting facility : culture vats, quantum relay and automated turrets.</li>
<li>Laboratory : scientists, servers, offices and meeting rooms.</li>
<li>Crew facility : off-duty crew, bedrooms, lounge and a conference room.</li>
<li>Security room : guards, drones, weapons and centralized surveillance.</li>
<li>Life support systems and utilities : fusion reactor, nanofabbers and atmosphere regulator.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="investigation-and-clue-pointers">Investigation and clue pointers</h2>
<p>Clue pointers are a way to prepare investigations. When you want the players to discover a hidden truth, you may lay clue pointers. A clue pointers has a central hidden truth and at least 3 clues pointing towards this hidden truth.</p>
<p>For instance it the players must investigate on the death of Varsal Lienman, the president of Cognifork, a psychotech corporation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hidden truth (Killer identity) : The killer was Nyru, a Yamagushi-gumi Yakuza operative.
Clues : 
- A symbol was carved with a vibroknife in the bioshell of the victim. With a bit of research, the symbol can be identified as the mon (crest) of the Yamagushi-gumi family.
- An interrogated yakuza of the Yamagushi-gumi may reveal that Nyru, the grandson of the local Oyabun is nowhere to be seen and that the Oyabun has given order to find him.
- The house AI last 24 hours history was wiped but she knows that Iris Lienman was in a relationship with Nyru.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For interesting and developed intrigues, mix and chain clue pointers :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hidden truth (Killer motivation) : The killer operated out of love for Lienman's daughter, Iris Lienman with whom he has a relationship. Varsal was violent with his daughter.
- Iris Lienman last grid traces were at her place when she deactivated her inserts. There's no trace of violence or robbery.
- Nothing has been stolen in Lienman habitat.
- The house AI last 24 hours history was wiped but she knows that Iris Lienman was in a relationship with Nyru.</p>
<p>Hidden truth (Red Queens's manipulation) : Nyru's love for Iris Lienman was artificially created through psychosurgery by the Red Queen, a exhuman psychosurgeon, in order to assassinate Varsal Lienman.
- Nyru behaves strangely, having coherence losses.
- Interrogated, Nyru doesn't remember the killing and says he awakened after the fact, covered in blood.
- A psychosurgical analysis of Nyru reveals the artificial rewiring of his affection towards Iris. A weird artificial neural nodule may also be found. Triggered, it makes Nyru say "All hail the Red Queen" then go berserk, then kill himself.</p>
<p>Hidden truth (Red Queen's conspiracy) : The Red Queen, impersonating the VP, assassinated Varsal Lienman to throw discredit on him and take his place.
- A red queen pawn was left near the body of Varsal Lienman and Nyru don't remember it.
- When they meet Varsal and his VP, Varsal fears he his going to be evicted and his VP is apologetic.
- Varsal gets ejected and the VP (really, the Red Queen) replaces him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clues may be given as such, may be triggered by specific actions or may be given as the result of a roll. Clues may be upfront relevant and interpretable or they may only be sensory, symbolic or material but their signification must be investigated. Always create at least 3 clues but don't hesitate to add more clues. Always have at least one clue given as such or easily accessed. If the fiction implies to reveal a clue, reveal it even if it's not on your clue pointers list. Do not hesitate to improvise new clues or to modify already existing clues during the session in order to both maintain fiction coherence and to feed information to your players.</p>
