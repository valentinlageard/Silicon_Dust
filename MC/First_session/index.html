<h2 id="creating-the-background">Creating the background</h2>
<p>Between 100 and 200 years from now, humanity had invented ego technology allowing people to be scanned, saved and loaded into other artificial bodies called shells. The development of neural interfaces allowed advanced prosthesis and augmentations. Space elevators allowed the colonization of the solar system. The centuries long process of Mars terraformation had begun using cutting edge nanotechnologies and biotechnologies. Not all humanity was augmented or wandering the solar system. Most of humanity still didn't have their ego scanned or never left Earth's ground, but some companies, states, tech-enthusiasts and outcasts were colonizing the solar system when the cataclysm happened. A cataclysm of epic proportion wiped out humanity on Earth and forced the rise of transhumanity. Since then, transhumanity is scattered in the solar system under the rules of transhuman quasi-states.</p>
<p>Why went wrong on Earth, causing the annihilation of humanity and the rise of transhumanity ? Players choose 1, MC chooses 1 secretly.
- World War III.
- Rogue AI.
- Nanotechnology event.
- Alien encounter.
- Unliveable climate.
- Biological threat.
- Physically mysterious event.
- Technological accident (experiment gone wrong, ...).
- Something else ?</p>
<p>Players get to tell how their choice gone wrong, how it manifested and how it's remembered.</p>
<p>How is Earth today ? Players choose 1, MC chooses 1.
- Dangerous nanotech clouds and colonies.
- Earth disappeared (how did it happen ?).
- Heavy radiation (coming from where ?).
- Rogue robots roam the place (doing what ?).
- Something forbids passage (what ?).
- Superstorms, acid rains, killing heat waves, ocean rising, ...
- The New Overton Window has a unique access to Earth.
- There are still people there (how do they survive ?).
- Weird lifeforms roam the place (how are they weird ?).
- Something else ?</p>
<h2 id="creating-the-new-overton-window">Creating the New Overton Window</h2>
<p>The New Overton Window represents the main political structure that governs most of transhumanity. The New Overton Window is a hypercapitalistic conglomerate of megacorporations. These megacorp run colonies </p>

<h3 id="habitat">Habitat</h3>
<p>An habitat is an artificial construct designed for transhuman to live in. Habitats come in various shapes and functionnalities :
- <strong>Aerostats</strong> are mobile stations supported by floating balloons in the dangerous atmospheres of Venus, Jupiter and Saturn. Aerostats benefits from the natural bodies of their planets. They use atmosphere processors to convert the external atmosphere into usable raw material but they always need mining importations for hard materials. On Venus, aerostats descend towards the planet surface at mining facilities to reload their stocks.
- <strong>Beehives</strong> are habitats drilled in asteroids. They consists of connected clusters of corridors and rooms. Beehives are interface with the void of space through pressurized locks. Most beehives have an external spaceport whethere as a small intellidome or a hard-material building. As they are built in asteroids, they usually are microgravity environments and consequently have confusing 3D architecture for transhumans not used to 0-g designs. Some modern beehives control and are built as arrays of concentric circles to use the asteroid rotation as artificial gravity. Beehives first use the rock and ice of their host asteroid as raw material for fabrication.
- <strong>Intellidomes</strong> are habitats built on terrestrial planets and asteroids. They consist of several layers of programmable nanotech that separates the dome internal atmosphere from the void of space or the planet's atmosphere. These programmable layers allow for shuttles with authorization to enter and exit the dome by opening and closing themselves in order to minimize atmosphere losses while allowing shuttles to come and go. Intellidomes are not always domes, they can be of various reconfigurable shapes but the term comes from early adoptions of this technology. Intellidomes can selectively filter light and radiation in order to protect its population and to recreate day-night cycles. They come in various sizes, from small stations of a few dozen meters to large cities of a few kilometers.
- <strong>O'Neill cylinders</strong> are huge nanocarbon cylinders rotating around their central axis to provide artificial gravity. Habitations are built [...]
- <strong>Space stations</strong> are habitats orbiting around a massive planetary or stellar body. Orbital stations are orbiting around a singular body, usually a planet while Lagrange stations are located at the stable lagrange points of some planet orbits. </p>
