<p><strong>AI</strong> : An Artificial Intelligence. This term is generally used to refer to simple artificial intelligences with specific purposes.</p>
<p><strong>AGI</strong> : An Artificial General Intelligence. This refers to <em>AI</em> capable of developing new skills and objectives. AGI are generally forbidden or heavily monitored in most societies as they are feared to become <em>singularities</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Angel</strong> : A personal assistant <em>AI</em> directly embedded in your <em>MPU</em>. Most people have angels since childhood and develop a particular relationship with them. As they are directly embedded in your <em>MPU</em>, they can interface with your perception and talk to you or even manifest visually in the <em>Mesh</em>. Angels are devoted and useful assistants that can use your inserts to navigate the <em>Grid</em>, helping you to access information, synthesize it, navigate easily, ... Angels are usually a <em>pseudofork</em> of their user or of someone close, but they may be entirely artificial intelligence with programmable personality, the pseudofork of a famous person or even more exotic things...</p>
<p><strong>Aug</strong> : An augmentation. A device integrated to your <em>shell</em> that provides you with an augmentation compared to base human.</p>
<p><strong>Bioshell</strong> : [...]</p>
<p><strong>Cortical stack</strong> : A chip that constantly scans your <em>MPU</em> and stores your <em>ego</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Daemon</strong> : An <em>Angel</em> with softwares allowing to anonymize its user. Contrary to most of the population, your actions may not publicly available on the <em>Grid</em>. Daemon fakes public authentications, automatically tries to remove or falsify your traces in the local <em>Mesh</em>, ...</p>
<p><strong>Ego</strong> : Your identity, your memories, hopes, beliefs, drives and regrets. It can be stored in an cortical stack that serves as a dynamic save in case your shell is destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>Exhuman</strong> : A transhuman that thinks ascension can be accessed only by rejecting what's left of humanity in transhumanity. While exhumans come in various shapes and the details of their ideology varies a lot, they all share this idea of abandonning the human drives and beliefs that we kept from our biological ancestry. Some of them push forking at its limits, creating competing communities of a single forked individual. Some interface with swarms of shells, others use nanotech swarms as a shell. Some study stolen alien artifacts to incorporate their technologies, others do even weirder stuffs in their hidden habitats. Exhumans are generally outcasts and some of them engage with terrorism to rebel against transhuman societies.</p>
<p><strong>Fork</strong> : A fork is a copied <em>ego</em>. As a copy, it has the same memories, drives, beliefs, ... Of course, once the fork is running on an independent <em>MPU</em>, it progressively becomes someone else, diverging while their experiences slowly drift from the original. Having multiple forks of the same ego is generally considered a major crime in most societies.</p>
<p><strong>Grid (The)</strong> : The Grid describes the entirety of the information networks used by transhumans. The Grid is not a single network with fixed protocols but is instead a collection of networks with various properties, more or less connected between one another. Some parts of the Grid are heavily surveilled and controlled, while others are totally anonymous and free. Some parts are corporate encrypted internal servers, anonymous black markets, gamified VR social networks, etc... The Grid is not just an abstract construct, parts of it are embedded in the physical world and are called <em>meshes</em>. Some transhuman even live exclusively on the Grid in their <em>infoshells</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Habitat</strong> : Habitats are the constructions where transhumans live. Habitats are what protect transhumanity against the void of the space, solar radiation, toxic atmospheres and extreme temperatures.</p>
<p><strong>Infoshell</strong> : [...]</p>
<p><strong>Mesh</strong> : A Mesh describes the local ecosystem of habitat-embedded technologies and connected objects. Meshes are the parts of the <em>Grid</em> that layers on top of the physical world.</p>
<p><strong>MPU</strong> : Mind Processing Unit. The part of your <em>shell</em> that loads your <em>ego</em> and runs it. It may be a biological brain, a silicon brain or even a server. Anything with enough computation power may be a MPU.</p>
<p><strong>Pseudofork</strong> : Similar to a <em>fork</em>, except that it only keeps specific part of your <em>ego</em> (preferences, semantics, ...) and runs an <em>AI</em> with this data. As such, a pseudofork actions are dependent on the motivation systems of the backend AI, but it adapts to your preferences, your way of speaking, etc... Pseudoforks are commonly used as <em>angels</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Resurrection insurance</strong> : [...]</p>
<p><strong>Shell</strong> : An artificial body that can be controlled from the inside by someone. Shells come in various shapes and functions.</p>
<p><strong>Singularity</strong> : An <em>AGI</em> that developed beyond transhuman intelligence. Singularities are feared as they may be too powerful to be controlled and because it's extremely hard to tune their objectives parameters in a safe way.</p>
<p><strong>Synthshell</strong> : [...]</p>
