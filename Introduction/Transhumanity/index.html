                <h1 id="transhumanity">Transhumanity</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<h2 id="ego-shells-and-angels">Ego, Shells and Angels</h2>
<p>In Silicon Dust, ego technology profoundly changed humanity and societies. The core idea of this technology is to digitalize the brain and run a near-perfect simulation of it in artificial brains. This allowed to directly interface our minds to technology. Since our minds could be stored as data, what's called an <strong>ego</strong>, the death of our body is not the death of the mind since a data save of the ego can be reloaded into another body. Bodies are <strong>shells</strong> now and egos can be loaded in these shells.</p>
<h2 id="the-grid">The Grid</h2>
<p>The Grid is the transhuman evolution of internet. From internet it kept the concept of being a communication network. But the Grid is much more than that. It's an ecosystem of various subnetworks, communications systems, protocols and habitat and things meshes all connected to one another through gateways and backdoors. The Grid varies from habitat to habitat. Habitat subnetworks come in all shades of surveillance, transparency, encryption level, anonymity, accessibility, services, reputation systems, ... In habitat with fascistic tendencies it may be hard to connect to the rest of the Grid, you may need a contact with access to a stealth satellite or admin access. In others, the Grid may easily be accessed but is easily traceable if you do not take proper precautions. In free habitats, anonymity may be a protocol-level feature allowing for free and anonymous access to the Grid.</p>
<h3 id="grid-inserts">Grid inserts</h3>
<p>Everyone, or almost everyone, has grid inserts in their shell, which are a set of augmentations designed to wirelessly connect to the Grid and interface it with your sensory systems. Grid inserts lets you and your angel access information on the grid, add layers of holograms in your perception and enter simulspaces.</p>
<h3 id="accessing-the-grid">Accessing the Grid</h3>
<p>Some systems offer free and secured access to the Grid, but others have ego verification measures and automatic surveillance AIs. In general, even if there is an authoritarian regime in charge, there is always some resistance running micro-satellites providing a connection to the rest of the Grid, you just have to find them. Note that because of the distance between stellar bodies, the Grid is asynchronous. Data from Pluto may not be accessible immediately from Mercury. However, </p>
<h3 id="alternate-reality-and-the-mesh">Alternate reality and the Mesh</h3>
<p>The Grid is also composed of layers and layers of virtual elements covering the physical reality of habitats. Your perception of habitats is enriched of holographic displays, spatialized sounds and even virtual taste and flavor. Parts of this alternate reality comes from your applications : a map application will display a minimap in your view field or indicate markers in the environment, social utils and network clients may print a data bubbles and public profiles of people surrounding you, weapon detection systems may highlight detected weapon in your view field, ...
Another layer of alternate reality comes from your direct environment. Most habitat structures and objects are directly interconnected forming the Mesh : the aggregate of embedded data and utilities. Doors may give you access data, the lightning system of rooms may be accessible, holographic advertising and tags cover the walls, weapons may print information such as the remaining ammo and the coils temperature, ...
Off-grid, society looks weird, people talk to invisible people, they make movements in the air, they seem to see things that are not there, ...</p>
<p>When you create an habitat, ask yourself what is the basic experience of the local mesh ? Is it standardized or diverse ? Minimalistic or saturated ? Functional or aesthetic ?</p>
<p>When you create your character, ask yourself how you configure your alternate reality settings ? What utilities you always have directly available ? What kind of experiences your angel filters or lets through in your perception ?</p>
<h3 id="virtual-reality-and-simulspaces">Virtual reality and simulspaces</h3>
<p>Another aspect of the everyday experience of transhumanity is virtual reality. Simulspaces are artificial virtual spaces allowing seemingly real experiences by transmitting perceptual data directly into grid inserts. Simulspaces of various sizes, populations and designs coexist in the Grid. Some are huge immersive games, others are virtual offices for corporations, others are artificial landscapes for virtual tourism, others are individual relaxation spaces, others are huge social cities, ... What you can do in simulspace depends on its programming. Some sandbox simulspaces give a lot of possibilities to build things but others only lets you move. The physics of simulspaces may be very realistic or outright weird with non-euclidean physics or anything in between. Simulspace time may go faster than real time but there may be limits to that.
All shells allow to create their own personal simulspaces and grid inserts allow people to access simulspaces on the Grid. While you may be blocked doing things in simulspaces, you may always log out as long as you have control of your grid inserts. However, an cortical stack running in an ego loader may not be able to log out allowing for effective accelerated torture.</p>
<h2 id="society">Society</h2>
<p>Human societies evolved into transhuman societies. ego technology removed the fear of death and profoundly shifted the spiritual values. Old religions couldn't keep up with the leap and new religions emerged. After the Fall, old states perished leaving the corporations taking the Overton window. They associated under the name of the Consortium. </p>
