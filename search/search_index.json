The core idea of this technology is to digitalize the brain and run a near-perfect simulation of it in artificial brains. This allowed to directly interface our minds to technology. Since our minds could be stored as data, what's called an ego , the death of our body is not the death of the mind since a data save of the ego can be reloaded into another body. Bodies are shells now and egos can be loaded in these shells. The Grid The Grid is the transhuman evolution of internet. From internet it kept the concept of being a communication network. But the Grid is much more than that. It's an ecosystem of various subnetworks, communications systems, protocols and habitat and things meshes all connected to one another through gateways and backdoors. The Grid varies from habitat to habitat. Habitat subnetworks come in all shades of surveillance, transparency, encryption level, anonymity, accessibility, services, reputation systems, ... In habitat with fascistic tendencies it may be hard to connect to the rest of the Grid, you may need a contact with access to a stealth satellite or admin access. In others, the Grid may easily be accessed but is easily traceable if you do not take proper precautions. In free habitats, anonymity may be a protocol-level feature allowing for free and anonymous access to the Grid. Grid inserts Everyone, or almost everyone, has grid inserts in their shell, which are a set of augmentations designed to wirelessly connect to the Grid and interface it with your sensory systems. Grid inserts lets you and your angel access information on the grid, add layers of holograms in your perception and enter simulspaces. Accessing the Grid Some systems offer free and secured access to the Grid, but others have ego verification measures and automatic surveillance AIs. In general, even if there is an authoritarian regime in charge, there is always some resistance running micro-satellites providing a connection to the rest of the Grid, you just have to find them. Note that because of the distance between stellar bodies, the Grid is asynchronous. Data from Pluto may not be accessible immediately from Mercury. However, Alternate reality and the Mesh The Grid is also composed of layers and layers of virtual elements covering the physical reality of habitats. Your perception of habitats is enriched of holographic displays, spatialized sounds and even virtual taste and flavor. Parts of this alternate reality comes from your applications : a map application will display a minimap in your view field or indicate markers in the environment, social utils and network clients may print a data bubbles and public profiles of people surrounding you, weapon detection systems may highlight detected weapon in your view field, ... Another layer of alternate reality comes from your direct environment. Most habitat structures and objects are directly interconnected forming the Mesh : the aggregate of embedded data and utilities. Doors may give you access data, the lightning system of rooms may be accessible, holographic advertising and tags cover the walls, weapons may print information such as the remaining ammo and the coils temperature, ... Off-grid, society looks weird, people talk to invisible people, they make movements in the air, they seem to see things that are not there, ... When you create an habitat, ask yourself what is the basic experience of the local mesh ? Is it standardized or diverse ? Minimalistic or saturated ? Functional or aesthetic ? When you create your character, ask yourself how you configure your alternate reality settings ? What utilities you always have directly available ? What kind of experiences your angel filters or lets through in your perception ? Virtual reality and simulspaces Another aspect of the everyday experience of transhumanity is virtual reality. Simulspaces are artificial virtual spaces allowing seemingly real experiences by transmitting perceptual data directly into grid inserts. Simulspaces of various sizes, populations and designs coexist in the Grid. Some are huge immersive games, others are virtual offices for corporations, others are artificial landscapes for virtual tourism, others are individual relaxation spaces, others are huge social cities, ... What you can do in simulspace depends on its programming. Some sandbox simulspaces give a lot of possibilities to build things but others only lets you move. The physics of simulspaces may be very realistic or outright weird with non-euclidean physics or anything in between. Simulspace time may go faster than real time but there may be limits to that. All shells allow to create their own personal simulspaces and grid inserts allow people to access simulspaces on the Grid. While you may be blocked doing things in simulspaces, you may always log out as long as you have control of your grid inserts. However, an cortical stack running in an ego loader may not be able to log out allowing for effective accelerated torture. Society Human societies evolved into transhuman societies. ego technology removed the fear of death and profoundly shifted the spiritual values.

The centuries long process of Mars terraformation had begun using cutting edge nanotechnologies and biotechnologies. Not all humanity was augmented or wandering the solar system. Most of humanity still didn't have their ego scanned or never left Earth's ground, but some companies, states, tech-enthusiasts and outcasts were colonizing the solar system when the cataclysm happened.

Habitat An habitat is an artificial construct designed for transhuman to live in. Habitats come in various shapes and functionnalities : - Aerostats are mobile stations supported by floating balloons in the dangerous atmospheres of Venus, Jupiter and Saturn. Aerostats benefits from the natural bodies of their planets. They use atmosphere processors to convert the external atmosphere into usable raw material but they always need mining importations for hard materials. On Venus, aerostats descend towards the planet surface at mining facilities to reload their stocks. - Beehives are habitats drilled in asteroids. They consists of connected clusters of corridors and rooms. Beehives are interface with the void of space through pressurized locks. Most beehives have an external spaceport whethere as a small intellidome or a hard-material building. As they are built in asteroids, they usually are microgravity environments and consequently have confusing 3D architecture for transhumans not used to 0-g designs. Some modern beehives control and are built as arrays of concentric circles to use the asteroid rotation as artificial gravity. Beehives first use the rock and ice of their host asteroid as raw material for fabrication. - Intellidomes are habitats built on terrestrial planets and asteroids. They consist of several layers of programmable nanotech that separates the dome internal atmosphere from the void of space or the planet's atmosphere. These programmable layers allow for shuttles with authorization to enter and exit the dome by opening and closing themselves in order to minimize atmosphere losses while allowing shuttles to come and go. Intellidomes are not always domes, they can be of various reconfigurable shapes but the term comes from early adoptions of this technology. Intellidomes can selectively filter light and radiation in order to protect its population and to recreate day-night cycles. They come in various sizes, from small stations of a few dozen meters to large cities of a few kilometers. - O'Neill cylinders are huge nanocarbon cylinders rotating around their central axis to provide artificial gravity. Habitations are built [...] - Space stations are habitats orbiting around a massive planetary or stellar body. Orbital stations are orbiting around a singular body, usually a planet while Lagrange stations are located at the stable lagrange points of some planet orbits.","title":"First session"},{"location":"MC/First_session/#first-session","text":"Everyone chooses a playbook, fills it and answers the question.

They consist of several layers of programmable nanotech that separates the dome internal atmosphere from the void of space or the planet's atmosphere. These programmable layers allow for shuttles with authorization to enter and exit the dome by opening and closing themselves in order to minimize atmosphere losses while allowing shuttles to come and go. Intellidomes are not always domes, they can be of various reconfigurable shapes but the term comes from early adoptions of this technology. Intellidomes can selectively filter light and radiation in order to protect its population and to recreate day-night cycles. They come in various sizes, from small stations of a few dozen meters to large cities of a few kilometers. - O'Neill cylinders are huge nanocarbon cylinders rotating around their central axis to provide artificial gravity. Habitations are built [...] - Space stations are habitats orbiting around a massive planetary or stellar body. Orbital stations are orbiting around a singular body, usually a planet while Lagrange stations are located at the stable lagrange points of some planet orbits.","title":"Habitat"},{"location":"MC/MC/","text":"MC rules To run the sessions, the MC has tools at his disposal : - Threats clocks and moves to manage looming and progressively developing threats. - Area networks and alarm clocks to manage infiltration and exfiltration of secure locations. - Clue pointers to manage investigations and the progressive revelation of hidden truths. - Heat clocks to manage how much the players are about to get caught by local authorities. - Trauma moves to manage how the player's trauma impact their life. - Habitat toolsets to create and manage habitats. - World map to keep track of the places established during play.

Since the invention of cortical stacks, the concept of individuality shifted to differentiate even more the difference between bodies (shells) and minds (ego). There are 3 main types of shells : Infoshells are virtual \"bodies\" connected to the Grid. Infoshells consist of a Mind Processing Unit that is usually connected to the Grid. As infoshells are not really a physical body, they cannot have usual augmentations. A infoshell character may not do physical actions and moves but still may have effects on the real world through the Grid. However, an infoshell may have a +Process or +Memetics bonuses as augs as if it was a Computation chip or a Social utils and has an equivalent of Grid inserts if it has a connection to the Grid. All physical shells (bio and synth) emulate infoshells when they connect to the Grid through Grid inserts . In simulspaces, infoshells can look like almost anything in the constraints of the simulspace programs. Bioshells are biological bodies. Bioshells may come through organic reproduction of compatible bioshells or may be clones fast grown in vats. Almost all bioshells are genetically fixed from congenital disorders and have basic biological augmentations such as a reinforced immunitary system. Bioshells Synthshells are synthetic bodies. They are made of metals and artificial composites. A \"naked\" synthshell costs 2-cred while a \"naked\" bioshell costs 3-cred . Add to that the corresponding cred of the basic augs it has and you have the final price. Directly buying shells isn't cheap and that's the reason for resurrection insurances. Cortical stacks [...] Augs Augs are devices directly integrated into a shell. A n-aug cost depends on the following rules : A 0-aug costs nothing. A 1-aug costs 2-cred . A 2-aug costs 5-cred upfront. If you already have an equivalent 1-aug , it costs 3-cred to upgrade. A 3-aug costs 10-cred upfront. If you already have an equivalent 2-aug , it costs 5-cred to upgrade. Basic augs Aesthetics augs 0-aug : Aesthetics augmentations.

Specific augs Antimatter bomb 2-aug 6-harm ap breach area far : When you want or just before dying, you can activate an internal antimatter bomb that deals 6-harm ap breach area in a far range. It kills you instantaneously, destroys your cortical stack as well as the cortical stacks of every shells killed by the explosion. Integrated antimatter bombs are rare and usually forbidden and almost exclusively used suicide missions and terrorism. Ballistics softwares 1-aug : Aiming correction and predictive ballistic stabilization giving a bonus of +1 when you're Deploying violence with a ranged weapon. Brace point 1-aug : You have a retractable gyroscopic arm that allows you to use braced directly on you shell.

Dead switch 1-aug : A small box containing a small nanoswarm designed to destroy the cortical stack on command or when the shell dies. This aug is used when you don't want your ego to fall in wrong hands. Extreme adaptation mods n-aug : Allows you to ignore certain kind of dangers and damages. For each n, your shell is adapted to 2 : extreme heat, extreme cold, 0g or low-g, high-g, void and high-pressure, radiation, under water, ... Synth shells are automatically adapted to low and high pressures. Faraday net 1-aug +faraday : A faraday net covers your shell protecting you against the effect of emp weapons. Fractal digits 1-aug : A set of fractally dividing digits to manipulate matter at the molecular level. Integrated ego loader* 1-aug : Allows you to load an cortical stack directly into your integrated simulspace. This aug allows you to interact in this simulspace with the ego and perform Psychosurgery*** on them. You can control whether the ego has access or not to your perceptions and you can give them control of your shell. Integrated electron impulser 1-aug : Allows to manipulate off-grid technology at a close range. Quantum relay 2-aug : A quantum relay allows you to instantaneously upload your ego, Angel and software to a server anywhere in the universe when you die. This allows to always retain the memory of your last moments. Stealth enhancements* 1-aug : This augmentations usually comes as sheets of epidermic metamaterials and silenced actuators giving a bonus of +1 to Infiltrate***. Throwing mods n-aug : You can throw anything at superhuman ranges and precision ( 1-aug : close/near , 2-aug : close/near/far , 3-aug : close/near/far/away ). Resurrection insurance Since ego technology has appeared, resurrection insurance were put in place. The principle is simple, you regularly upload your ego in a server used as a backup and when you die, the insurance loads your backup in a new shell if it hasn't retrieved your cortical stack. Various levels of insurance allow for various levels of service. In mechanical terms you must pay your insurance at the beginning of the session. You can select any level of insurance as long as you have the cred to pay it. If you die during the session, you benefit from the insurance, if you don't die, well, too bad. Resurrection insurance levels : 0-cred resurrection insurance : Regular backup and minimal infoshell processing in case you die. 1-cred resurrection insurance : Regular backup and 2-aug shell, the MC describes its type and look. 2-cred resurrection insurance : Regular backup and a 4-aug shell, you detail its type and look. 3-cred resurrection insurance : Regular backup and an identical shell with as many aug as you had when died or a tailored 6-aug shell, you detail its type and look. Angel/Daemon An angel is an intelligent device that allows you to access and retrieve information, connect to other devices, communicate with the Grid, run your softwares, ... It's essentially a intelligent multi-purpose computer. It can be a portable device with a screen and buttons or can be an integrated aug that interfaces with your augmented reality. Often, it has an intelligent interface that is a pseudofork of its owner. A daemon is exactly the same thing except it's designed to anonymize its user and encrypt its communications. Some models even control your angel to make it look like you're elsewhere doing something else. Common in societies that value privacy but forbidden in authoritarian regimes. Weapons Firearms When you create a firearm, choose a frame , its projectile(s) and its mod(s) , name it and pay for it. It's always 1-cred + additional creds for additional projectiles and mods.
